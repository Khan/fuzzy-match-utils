# fuzzy-match-utils

A collection of string matching algorithms built with
[React Select](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select) in mind.

## Installation

```
npm install --save fuzzy-match-utils
```

## Usage

This module exports four utility functions:

- `filterOptions`
- `typeaheadSimilarity`
- `fullStringDistance`
- `cleanUpText`

They're well documented in [main.js](./src/main.js).

It also exports a [Flow type](https://flowtype.org/) for `Option`, if you're
into that sort of thing.

**Usage examples comingâ€¦ soon?**
